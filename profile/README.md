# NTNU Courses ðŸŽ“

This organization contains all of my (Sivert Utne's) repositories related to all education at Norwegian University of Science and Technology. This includes subjects part of my Bachelor and Master.

I would reccomend having a look at the pinned repositories if you want to have a look, as these are the most complete and documented ones. Especially the older subjects are not as easy on the eyes, mostly in norwegian, and often lack content and documentation/images etc. I will however try to update old subjects and fill in gaps when i find the time and energy to do so.
